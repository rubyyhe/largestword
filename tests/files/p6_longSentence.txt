Very happy with the code challenge and good luck to myself!

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and 
computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available 
to many users over the Internet.[1] Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations 
from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.
Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds[2][3]), or be available to many organizations (public cloud).
